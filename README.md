## AI Speeding Ticket System

The Automatic Traffic Ticket System is developed to streamline the process of issuing traffic fines. It includes the following subsystems:

1. **Violation Processing Subsystem**

   - Manages the processing of traffic violations.

2. **AI Recognition Subsystem**

   - Utilizes AI to recognize license plates.

3. **Vehicle Registration Information Subsystem**

   - Manages vehicle registration data.

4. **Manual Recognition Subsystem**

   - Handles cases where AI recognition confidence is low, delegating to human operators.

5. **Issuing and Reporting Subsystem**

   - Issues fines upon confirmation of violations and identification of violators.

6. **National Violation Event Management Dashboard**
   - Provides a comprehensive dashboard for managing and monitoring traffic violation events nationwide.
